# _Site by Template_

**_This site was built using a template from "Figma.com"_**

- The site was built in 8-9 hours.

- When you build a site using a template, it's very easy; you don't need to worry about photos, text, or fonts. But sometimes, if you want to make the site look nicer, you can customize everything and change the font and so on. Personally, that's what I did.
